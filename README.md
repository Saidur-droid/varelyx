# Varelyx

**Know what matters. Ask what is missing. Prove what works. Then act.**

Varelyx is an evidence-driven retail continuity prototype for the Google Cloud AI Builder Cup 2026, Retail & Commerce theme.

## Competition deployment path

The final no-card competition path is:

**Firebase Hosting (Spark) -> Firebase AI Logic -> Gemini Developer API -> Anonymous Firebase Auth -> Realtime Database**

No Vercel. No Supabase. No Blaze upgrade is required for the primary submission path.

The public web prototype uses Gemini to interpret messy Bangla/Banglish/English disruption evidence and generate a focused evidence question. Operational quantities are computed by deterministic constrained logic, not invented by the model. An independent Proof Gate can HOLD or BLOCK unsafe plans before human approval.

## Current working flow

1. Analyze a disruption message with Gemini.
2. Separate Known / Estimated / Unknown evidence.
3. Surface the highest-value missing fact.
4. Confirm Supplier B Thursday capacity.
5. Recompute current / cheapest / balanced / maximum-availability plans.
6. Prove the balanced plan -> PASS.
7. Try an intentionally unsafe proposal -> BLOCK.
8. Approve the verified plan.
9. Persist action objects in Firebase Realtime Database.
10. Compare the response in Shadow Mode.

All impact values in the demo are controlled-simulation outputs, not observed retailer results.

## Google/Firebase stack

- Firebase Hosting — public competition web app.
- Firebase AI Logic — client integration to Gemini.
- Gemini Developer API — live generative evidence understanding.
- Firebase App Check + reCAPTCHA Enterprise — abuse protection.
- Firebase Anonymous Authentication — isolated judge/browser demo sessions.
- Firebase Realtime Database — persisted session/action state.
- Deterministic constrained solver + Proof Gate — quantities and hard-rule verification.

The repository also keeps the earlier FastAPI / OR-Tools backend prototype and Cloud Run Docker path as an optional engineering reference. It is **not required** for the no-card competition deployment.

## Firebase project

Project ID:

    varelyx-ai-builder-cup

Expected public URL after deployment:

    https://varelyx-ai-builder-cup.web.app

## Deploy on Windows

The project is already bound in `.firebaserc`.

Double-click:

    deploy-firebase.cmd

The helper uses `npx firebase-tools`, opens Firebase login when needed, and deploys Hosting plus Realtime Database rules.

Manual equivalent:

    npx --yes firebase-tools@latest login
    npx --yes firebase-tools@latest deploy --only hosting,database

Do **not** run `firebase init`; the repository already contains the required Firebase configuration.

## Required production verification

After deployment, verify all of these on the public URL:

- Header reports Firebase connected / Gemini ready.
- Analyze disruption returns **LIVE GEMINI VERIFIED**.
- Supplier capacity 120 resolves the critical unknown.
- Balanced plan -> PASS.
- Unsafe proposal -> BLOCK.
- Approval creates backend action objects.
- Refresh preserves the session state/actions.
- Simulation values remain explicitly labelled.

- `COMPETITION_RULES_LOCK.md`
- `docs/FIREBASE_NO_CARD_DEPLOY.md`
- `docs/SUBMISSION_READY.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`


## Cloud development

Varelyx can be developed without a local PC by opening this repository in GitHub Codespaces. The devcontainer pins Node 22 and Python 3.12, installs Python and Node dependencies, and forwards port 4173 for local preview.

Core verification commands:

```bash
npm run check:js
npm run test:node
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
python -m http.server 4173 -d public
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173 npm run test:e2e
npx --yes firebase-tools@latest projects:list
```

Do not store Firebase CLI login tokens, service-account JSON, or personal Google credentials in the repository. GitHub Actions preview deployment is designed to use short-lived Google Workload Identity Federation credentials.
