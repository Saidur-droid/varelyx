# Varelyx Deployment Status

Last updated: 2026-09-30

## Official production

- Firebase project: `varelyx-ai-builder-cup`
- Official Hosting URL: https://varelyx-ai-builder-cup.web.app
- Final merged main commit verified: `cedcd678eb8a3caeb043aeb8a9d27d8e95ab041e`
- Realtime Database rules: deployed
- Firebase Anonymous Authentication: enabled
- Firebase AI Logic / Gemini: enabled
- Firebase App Check: enabled with reCAPTCHA Enterprise
- Production release controller: `varelyx-firebase-release-controller`

## Final technical release gate

Verified from the merged `main` commit through the Render release controller:

- Node/source verification: **85/85 passed**
- Python reference verification: **13/13 passed**
- Firebase Hosting deploy: **passed**
- Official host served the latest Decision Command Center
- App Check CI registration: **passed**
- Live production Playwright QA: **7 passed, 2 intentionally skipped, 0 failed**
- Release log ended with **FIREBASE RELEASE VERIFIED**

The live judge flow proved:
1. Firebase server read verified.
2. Real Gemini analysis -> **LIVE GEMINI VERIFIED**.
3. Missing evidence -> **HOLD**.
4. Human-reviewed supplier capacity resolves the critical unknown.
5. Balanced candidate -> **PASS**.
6. Unsafe candidate -> **BLOCK**.
7. Balanced candidate -> **PASS** again.
8. Human approval creates sandbox-only actions.
9. Firebase write/read-back -> **FIREBASE SAVE VERIFIED**.
10. Reload restores server state/actions.

Negative persistence/transport tests cover permission denied, network failure, read-back mismatch, concurrent revision conflict, timeout, missing ETag and anonymous UID isolation.

## Render service interpretation

Authoritative release gate:
- `varelyx-firebase-release-controller`

Supporting preview gates:
- `varelyx-preview-qa`
- `varelyx-browser-qa`

Legacy services `varelyx-firebase-live-qa` and `varelyx-firebase-postrelease-qa` may still display historical failed-deploy badges. They are not the authoritative final release gate and should not be used to judge current production health.

## Technical status

**Coding/release phase: complete.**

PR #1 was merged to `main`; the merged main commit was deployed to official Firebase and the final production verification gate passed.

## Remaining work is submission-side only

- final judge-flow browser walkthrough / presentation QA
- final <=3-minute public demo video
- final proposal/PDF claims reconciled to observed behavior
- public repo/demo links as required by the competition
- eligible 2-4 person team and profile/activity/eligibility checks
- logged-out testing of every submitted link
- portal fields, final submission and saved receipt/confirmation

Do not claim the competition submission itself is complete until those submission gates are closed.
